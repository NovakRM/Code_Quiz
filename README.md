A whole slew of fun. Decrimenting intervals in a timer, local storage, objects, yeehaw.

Got timer to start, decriment, and stop when the quiz ends
Used alerts to inform user of when an answer they gave was incorrect
Got logic functioning to populate quiz with questions and cycle through them
Got the webpage to locally store and retrieve a score, but there's a bug I can't figure out with the score's textcontent being above 0 wiping all other elements on the score page.
